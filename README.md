# Personal-Spending-Intelligence-System

Raw banking transaction data lacks meaningful structure and actionable insights for individuals.
This project aims to transform personal transaction data into a spending intelligence system that:

categorises spending behaviour

detects recurring subscriptions

identifies unusual or anomalous transactions

provides clear, actionable financial insights through an interactive dashboard

This is clear, real, and employer-friendly.
